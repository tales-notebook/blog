Hey everyone,

This post is to talk about beta v0.1.0, that is also the very first version of the platform Tales Notebook.

On this initial phase we wanna focus on bugfixes and improvements in the platform, so not all features will be available yet but they will be released with time.

## Accounts

On this version only **creator** and **reader** account types will be available.

We already have the **translator** account ready but we wanna focus on this accounts first to make sure everything is working as expected.

> Also take note that accounts created on this version will be the same as on the definitive version too, so if you wanna save a username, you can do it now.

## Subscription & Payments

Subscriptions and payments will not be available yet on this version.

On our sandbox environment we already have the system working, but since the system will have to deal with international taxes that is a bit more complex, we wanna work on it a bit more before releasing it.

## Contact and Support

Our support channel for now will be via email, so in case you have any questions, wanna report a bug or need help with something, please contact us at contact@tales-notebook.com
