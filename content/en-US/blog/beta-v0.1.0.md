# Beta v0.1.0

Hey everyone,

This post is to announce the release of beta v0.1.0 and explain some details how this first version will work.

At first we wanna focus on bugfixes and improvements of the experience and features of the platform.

> Take note that login and accounts created on this version will be the same as on the definitive version too, so if you wanna save a username, you can do it now.

## Accounts

On this version only creator & reader accounts will be available.

We already have the translator account ready but we wanna focus on this accounts first to make sure everything is working as expected.

But we will soon release the translator account not very long after this version.

## Subscription & Payments

Subscriptions and payments will not be available yet on this version.

On our sandbox environment we already have the subscription and payment system working, but we still need to work on taxes and other legal stuff to make sure everything is working as expected and we are not breaking any laws.

## Support

In case you have any questions or need help, please contact us at contact@tales-notebook.com

## Next releases

The next releases for now will be focused on bugfixes and improving the creator and reader experience and features.
